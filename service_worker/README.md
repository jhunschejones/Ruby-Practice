# Service Worker

## Overview

This project takes advantage of my Sinatra browser template to test out a basic service worker implementation as a part of my preparation for adding PWA support to another project I was working on. If you run the app and toggle your internet off, you should see the color of the home page change!

To run the app:
1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run `sudo bundle install`.
2. After installing the necessary Ruby gems, run `ruby sinatra_browser.rb` to launch the app.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/` to send traffic to the web page.
