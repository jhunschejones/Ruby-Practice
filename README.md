# Ruby Projects

I have spent time studying several different technology stacks and software tools, but Ruby will always have a special place in my heart as it was the language that really got me hooked on coding. Without any prior OOP experience I was able to put together a console app that played out a choose-your-own-adventure game, complete with character health and items. In the time since those early days, I have come back to Ruby several times as my coding knowledge has grown. This repository houses a representative summary of the types of Ruby coding projects I've built during this time. Feel free to contact me with any feedback you have, I'm always happy to receive input!

## Repo Contents:

* [Ruby The Hard Way](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Ruby%20The%20Hard%20Way): This folder holds the practice files from my most recent pass through this incredibly helpful book. I'd recommend checking out [`ex43.rb`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/blob/master/Ruby%20The%20Hard%20Way/ex43.rb) as an example of a fun, class-based console adventure game.
* [Ruby Essentials](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Ruby%20Essentials): I built these console apps while refreshing my Ruby knowledge in preparation for an interview. It was fun to see how much of the development knowledge I had gained in the .NET and Node spaces helped me retain more of my learning this time around!
  * [Food Finder](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Ruby%20Essentials/food_finder): A console app that uses a plain text datastore to house restaurant information, allowing users to add and search amongst available data.
  * [`file_review.rb`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/blob/master/Ruby%20Essentials/file_review.rb): A console app that a user can run in a folder to set a timespan and archive old files in a new directory of their choosing.
    * I really enjoyed the way this application challenged me to parse user input in a way that feels intuitive to the user, but handles as many common edge-cases as possible. A good example is some internet downloads can be automatically named simply, like `photo.png`. If a user were to use this tool twice in the same directory, selecting the same archive directory each time, I had to create a way to modify duplicate file names so that the program does now write over the first files put in the archive folder.
* [Sinatra Blog](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Sinatra%20Blog): A web app that uses a SQLite database and active record to implement full CRUD functionality for plain-text blog posts.
* [Sinatra Blog 2](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Sinatra%20Blog%202): This is a more fully-featured blog application that uses an AWS-hosted Postgres database along with Sinatra and Active Record. Still under construction!
* [Rails Blog](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Rails%20Blog): A web app that implements CRUD functionality for users and microposts, using Rails and Active Record with SQLite in dev and Postgres in prod.
* [Text Formatter](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Text%20Formatter): A Ruby console application built for a coding challenge in late 2018. Check out the included `REQUIREMENTS.md` for the challenge requirements, then scan through [`format-text.rb`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/blob/master/Text%20Formatter/format-text.rb) to see how I implemented these features in a way that gracefully handles any kind of user input. You can also just download the application and test files and run the code on your own machine to see it in action!
* [Generator](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Ruby-Projects/tree/master/Generator): A Ruby console application that allows users to build their own HTML web app that in turn generates funny names or phrases based on a list of words to randomize.
