# Ruby-Practice

This repository is for my Ruby practice files created while working through Zed Shaw's coding book, ['Learn Ruby The Hard Way'](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). I do not own the content from this book, but the work displayed here is my own. Ruby is an object oriented language like C#, but with what feels to me like a very different syntax and workflow. I will post more here about challenges and learning opportunities I experience along the way as I work through the book. Thanks for stopping by to take a look at what I've been up tp!
