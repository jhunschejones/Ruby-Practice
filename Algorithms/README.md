# Algorithms

This directory is for Ruby implementations of some common algorithms I was learning in the spring of 2019. If you see any errors or improvements, definitely feel free to submit a pull request or contact me directly. I'm always happy to meet more fellow developers and I believe everybody knows something I can learn from.
