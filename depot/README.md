# Depot

## Overview
This is a toy app I built while working through [Agile Web Development with Rails 5.1](https://pragprog.com/book/rails51/agile-web-development-with-rails-5-1). I typed all the application code myself, though as you may notice when spinning the app up, several design decisions were made by the authors.

## Lessons Learned
I am looking forward to the opportunity to integrate React with a Rails 5 app, along with the chance to dig more deeply into more areas where Rails shines as a tool to speed up the process of making a client idea into a production application.
