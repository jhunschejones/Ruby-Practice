# Depot

## Overview
This is a toy app I built while working through [Agile Web Development with Rails 5.1](https://pragprog.com/book/rails51/agile-web-development-with-rails-5-1).

## Lessons Learned
The authors of this book did a great job covering some important edges of Rails that I was not previously familiar with. Partway through completing the project, I have already learned a whole new approach to testing than the rspec + mocks + factory patterns I was used to. I also appreciate the way the code is written in iterations similar to the Agile workflows I've followed on real world dev teams. It has helped me to see how Rails can be a tool for fast prototyping when working with a client, and definitely moves this tool up my list of quick-moving options for my next project.
