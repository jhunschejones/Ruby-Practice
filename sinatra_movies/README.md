# Sinatra Movies

## Overview
This is a small project I created while brushing up on Ruby language basics in the spring of 2019. It was a refresher for the Sinatra web framework as well as the first time I used Ruby's YAML library. In the past I've created fairly complex logic for dumping data to text files from console apps, but working with YAML in Ruby is nothing like that! It was super easy to store and retrieve data on the fly without having to worry about parsing input and what delimiters to use for dividing up records. Obviously this doesn't replace the power of an actual relational database, but it makes for a useful tool when working with data in local scripts.

To run the app, copy this directory and run `ruby -I lib app.rb` from the root of the project.
