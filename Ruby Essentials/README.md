# Ruby Essentials

This repository features a couple console apps I built in the fall of 2018 while refreshing my Ruby knowledge in preparation for an interview. It was fun to see how much of the development knowledge I had gained in the .NET and Node spaces helped me retain more of my learning this time around!

* **Food Finder:** A console app that uses a plain text datastore to house restaurant information, allowing users to add and search amongst available data.
* **file_review.rb:** A console app that a user can run in a folder to set a timespan and archive old files in a new directory of their choosing. I really enjoyed the way this application challenged me to parse user input in a way that feels intuitive to the user, but handles as many common edge-cases as possible. A good example is some internet downloads can be automatically named simply, like photo.png. If a user were to use this tool twice in the same directory, selecting the same archive directory each time, I had to create a way to modify duplicate file names so that the program does now write over the first files put in the archive folder.
